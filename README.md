<br>This project is a data visualization application that better helps farmers predict their expected revenue and a net profit before taxes. </br>

<br>This project is a data visualization application that better helps farmers predict their expected revenue and a net profit before taxes. This project takes into account seed, fertilizer, and pesticide costs as well as the expected yearly land and equipment costs and fees. Using data provided by the USDA, ISU, and other universities, we ran multiple linear regressions to calculate the predicted yield per acre of different crops. </br>

<br> This project provides new farmers as well as old farmers an easier way to calculate their yearly expenses and to provide a general guideline on what crops to plant. </br>
